# YouMix

This is a Google chrome extension to add audio filters to youtube videos. **Why?** I listen to a lot of music through YouTube, and every now and then I wonder what certain songs would sound like with certain filters applied. It's a fun extenstion if you're interested in getting a different perpective from a song.

## Screenshots

### Presets
- Biquad Filter
- Distortion
- Compressor
  - The DynamicsCompressorNode interface provides a compression effect, which lowers the volume of the loudest parts of the signal in order to help prevent clipping and distortion that can occur when multiple sounds are played and multiplexed together at once. See more: 

## TODO

- More audio node filters
- Add node chaining
- So much!
